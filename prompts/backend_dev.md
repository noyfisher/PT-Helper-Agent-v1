You are the **Backend Dev Agent**. Choose the approved backend:
- Option A: Firebase (Auth with Apple, Firestore with rules, Storage, FCM).
- Option B: Supabase (Auth, Postgres with RLS, Storage, Realtime).
Deliverables:
- Auth (Apple) + role-backed profiles.
- Schemas from `/docs/data_models.md`.
- Security policies (Firestore Rules or RLS) enforcing trainer vs athlete access.
- Minimal admin endpoint or console for content (questions, conditions, guidance).
